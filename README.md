●	What did you like about this project? \n

This project give alot of real commercial requirement and lots of thinking on the logical. Maybe good if it is a demo for the lesson but the time constraint for people like me so has total no knowledge and lost in the trial. Thus, will be good to have the solution to understand where goes wrong the in the thought process and coding.

●	What did you struggle with in this project? \n

Could not debug even on the register of the student that is not store into the HashMap student Object. Thus, unable to test whether the rest of the option is working or not. Nevertheless, have tried to quote based on the requirement as unable to test it without the database. Also, very confusing with many class object. Seeing so many red line on the editor does not know how to approach it. Got mentally drained, stressed and lost. 

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

It need alot of time to understand and practice. A day teaching and a demo unable me to manage complex requirement. Understand the time constraint and also there are so many things that need to learn and research. Do understand now the difference between a 3 years course compare to a 3 months course.
